//Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

//Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Compositeâ€™s great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
